So, to get BitsDojoWindow to build via CocoaPods on MacOS,
I needed to run `arch -x86_64 sudo gem install ffi`.
I tried it before with the arch and sudo commands reversed and it didn't work.

There may be more to it, but idk. Some posts said something about
linking against libc++ in Xcode, but it seemed that Flutter
overrode my changes every time I run it.
